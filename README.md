Whiplash API V1 - Ruby Client
================================

This library provides a wrapper around the [Whiplash][whiplash] [Merchandising REST API][api] for use within Ruby apps or via the console.

### Requirements

- Ruby 1.9.3+
- Rubygems
- JSON
- ActiveResource

A valid API key (v1) or Oauth token (v2) is required to authenticate requests. You can find your API key on your customer account page.

You can also use the test API key `Hc2BHTn3bcrwyPooyYTP` to test this client.

### Installation

```
gem install whiplash_api
```

Or if you're using Bundler:

```
gem 'whiplash_api'
```

### Configuration

To use the API client in your Ruby code, provide the required credentials as follows:

```
require 'rubygems'
require 'whiplash_api'

WhiplashApi::Base.api_key = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXX'
```
An error will be raised if no API key is provided.

### API Versions

The default Whiplash API is v1 and uses API keys. The v2 API uses Oauth, and is currently available in private beta.

Both API versions are fully supported by this gem. Unless specified, API v1 is used.

NOTE: The API Key is your OAuth access token if you are using API v2. If you want to use API v2, call `.api_version` before setting the OAuth token:

```
WhiplashApi::Base.api_version = 1
WhiplashApi::Base.api_key = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXX'
```

### Sandbox usage

You'll likely want to start by testing in the Sandbox:

```
 WhiplashApi::Base.testing!
```

You can, also, check a very basic implementation/example inside `exe/whiplash_api` file.

### Usage

The API currently gives you access to all endpoints supported by [Whiplash][whiplash] [Merchandising API][api].

```
$ irb
>
> WhiplashApi::Base.api_key = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXX'
>
> items = WhiplashApi::Item.all
>
> items = WhiplashApi::Item.sku('SOME-SKU-111')
>
> order = WhiplashApi::Order.last
>
> orders = WhiplashApi::Order.all(:params => {:status => 'shipped', :created_at_min => '2008-01-01'})
>
> order_item = WhiplashApi::OrderItem.originator(ID_IN_YOUR_STORE)
>
```

### Contributing to the Whiplash API Gem

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.

### Testing Whiplash API Gem

You can run the tests on the current version of this gem, by cloning it
locally. Tests require setting up the following environment variables:

```
WL_API_KEY=Hc2BHTn3bcrwyPooyYTP # for testing if API v1 support
WL_OAUTH_KEY=23447e1eaeddf2d1c4af4c9cf88524af2863cb1f72d500dd9328b34735a3f3b0 # for testing if API v2 support
WL_API_VERSION=2 # By default, API v2 is used for all tests, but can be toggled using this.
WL_CUSTOMER_ID=242 # Use the given Customer ID for API v2
rspec spec
```

You can skip checking support for API v1 by not setting the corresp. env
variable.

You can skip teardown for the tests (where the test suite
removes/deleted instances of created resources on the testing server) by
setting an environment variable `NO_TEARDOWN`.

Note that, testing can take a long time, since tests are performed
directly on the testing server, and no mocks are used. This is to ensure
that the API conforms to the tests, at the same time.
